Kcikstarter Analysis Challenge

Purpose of Analysis:
     
The purpose of this analysis was to review and clean up over 4,000 pieces of data related to various international projects for funding.  We worked to develop skills in reviewing, sorting and clarifying large data sets in a much more efficient manner.  We achieved this by learning various formulas used in Excel to ensure the data was formatted properly based on the information contained within cells, rows or columns.  

Analysis and Challenges:

The interesting thing about data sets are that they tell a story.  Perhaps not initially, but once we "clean" and organize the data we can begin to see trends, highs, lows, good, bad, etc.  This data is what helps leaders make decisions.  Various plots and graphs can show waiting times, or dollar amounts, or almost anything needed to help better understand the next appropriate move for leadership or stakeholders.  

So if analysis of the data tells a story, who are the characters and how do we introduce them?  What are the challenges in connecting them all to tell that story?  Some of the challenges I ran into with this data revolved aorund which version of excel was being used.  Running data sets on Mac vs a PC does not always affect the outcomes, but it can vary some.  When I open the spreadsheet I have saved, I noticed that I am asked if I want to update the version of Excel.  If I choose yes, my formulas donot work and where there were numbers in cells, it would then read VALUE! instead.  Other challenges incude knowing which graph or chart will tell your stopry the best, sometimes a bar graph is nice, but a plot chart may work better.  

Results:

Our results from the data indicate that July owuld be the best month for launching a play (109) but also had the 2nd highest failed rate (50).  I think our data set is limited by the data it contains, when we oculd learn more about backers or those who funded the successful plays as well as other ventures.  Research is missing in answering why those were really succssful.  Overall, it was an intersting view fo how excel can be utilized to take amounts of data and turn it into a graph, or chart to tell your story.
